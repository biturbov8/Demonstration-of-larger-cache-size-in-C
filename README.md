# Demonstration-of-larger-cache-size-in-C 


## Overview
This project simulates a cache system to analyze its performance metrics such as miss rate, average hit time, and average access time under varying cache sizes.

## Motivation
Understanding cache behavior is crucial for optimizing memory access and improving overall system performance in computer systems.

## Features
- Simulates cache behavior with varying cache sizes
- Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy
- Measures cache miss rate, average hit time, and average access time
- Adjustable parameters for cache size, data array size, and number of iterations

## Getting Started
To run the simulation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using your preferred C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage
- Adjust the parameters in the code (e.g., cache size, array size, iterations) as needed.
- Run the compiled executable to perform the cache simulation.
- View the output to analyze cache performance metrics for different cache sizes.
